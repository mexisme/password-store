* Tasks
** TODO Port to Rust or Go-lang
   - Single binary
   - Not reliant on bash
   - Easily compilable / portable to several architectures
** TODO Support for different file-formats beyond `.txt`
   - YAML support pre-text, then the `---` divider
     - Already mostly fits-in with the author's suggested format
   - JSON probably wouldn't work
   - TOML is very minimalistic and tightly specified, and indent-agnostic
** MAYBE Index file, for obfuscating the file-names
   - Would rely on GPG-decrypt timeouts, etc
** MAYBE `passd`
   - `pass` background daemon, a la `ssh-agent` or `gpg-daemon`
